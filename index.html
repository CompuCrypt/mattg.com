          <h3>Week 1</h1>
          <p>When I first started this program I had no idea what to expect.  I have never done any coding or programing and
            I have never taken an online class.  The first introduction classes helped give me confidence and showed
            me more of what I could expect.</p>
          <p>The first week we got into doing HTML coding.  It is a lot easier than I expected but also challenging at the same time.  
            The hardest part for me is remembering exactly what I need to put for tags and elements but there are plenty of resourses to help.
            I actually enjoy it more that I thought I would.  I really like playing with the tags and elements to see how they change when I view them on the webpage.</p>

          <h3>Week 2</h3>
          The second week has been a disaster!  Not because my the course or the instructors.  The instructors and TAs are great by the way!
          But because of my internet.  They have been doing work in my neighborhood and the internet has been going
          out everyday.  On Tuesday I couldn't finish my homework before work that night because my internet was out.
          I decided to take work off that night so I could complete my work but the internet service was never restored that night.
          Since I work two jobs on Wednesday I ended up having to take off more time to complete my work.  It felt good to have it done.
          Then Thurday came...  The class was going good and then I lost internet in the middle of it.  Luckly I live close to the office I work at
          so I was able to go up there and join back with the class.  It has been a frustrating week.  But I still have learened a lot and excited to learn more.
